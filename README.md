## **The `data-gambling-cbt` dataset** ðŸ“Š 


The `data-gambling-cbt` dataset is a meta-analytic research domain [MARD](https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf)) which is part of the  [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). The dataset contains study information and effect size data of randomized trials on cognitive-behavioral techniques (CBTs) for problem gambling and gambling disorder. The date of the last search update is provided [here](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-gambling-cbt/blob/main/metadata/last_search.txt). More details about this database can be accessed in the published [meta-analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16221).

This dataset includes psychotherapies for BPD  vs. control comparisons. Effect sizes are provided for two types of outcomes at post-test: 1) overall BPD severity (based on any validated clinician or self-rated instrument for BPD severity) and 2) suicidal behaviour (combined rate of suicide attempts and death by suicide). 


The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/).
