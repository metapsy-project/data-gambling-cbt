This variable is set to NA (missing) when the study was not a multiarm trial. For example, if a multiarm trial employed two types of control groups, waitlist and placebo, this variable would be set to wl and plac, respectively. Typically, multiarm trials employ two or more active treatments (e.g. CBT and problem-solving therapy), which are compared to the same control group (e.g. a waitlist).
